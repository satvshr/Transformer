all-but-forgotten\\r\\r\\nmasterwork, Jean Stafford—who was once\\r\\r\\nwidely regarded as the leading novelist\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nof her generation, and who wrote\\r\\r\\nthis perverse, short,\\r\\r\\nlyrical novel, her second, during\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nthe flailing failings\\r\\r\\nof her marriage to my hero\\r\\r\\nRobert Lowell—kills\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nMolly, her child-alter ego,\\r\\r\\na girl too unloved and unloving\\r\\r\\nto survive puberty, too\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\npure and awful—like Stafford, who died\\r\\r\\npickled and childish three\\r\\r\\ndecades later after winning\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nthe Pulitzer with her devastating,\\r\\r\\nhurtfully compassionate Collected Stories—for this or any other world,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nespecially the necessarily\\r\\r\\nallegorical one of fiction.\\r\\r\\nI am broken now, hopeless; hope\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nis proved by this book to be\\r\\r\\na contrivance. I have just\\r\\r\\nread the last pages in which\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nMolly’s brother, Ralph—who,\\r\\r\\nto live, cannot love\\r\\r\\neither, has no spare love—shoots\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nher, aiming for the wild mountain\\r\\r\\nlion whose stuffed corpse\\r\\r\\nwas to be the triumph\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nof his new manhood. I don’t\\r\\r\\nhate Ralph—how can I, a boy,\\r\\r\\nmistaken, like me? And can I hate\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nMolly, who so needed Ralph\\r\\r\\nand everyone, still young enough to savor\\r\\r\\nthe bittersweet of her anger?\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nWhat about Stafford, who hurt\\r\\r\\nherself, all our selves, with\\r\\r\\nthis ending, her classic tragedy, writing,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ndecades later, Poor old Molly! I loved her dearly and I hope she rests in peace.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nFuck insight and analysis:\\r\\r\\nmy heart is shot. Why\\r\\r\\ndid she have to die? Why does\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nanyone? Why do you, do I?\\r\\r\\nBecause of what Ralph was\\r\\r\\nfeeling just before he accidentally\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nslaughtered the future? This book\\r\\r\\nmust have ravaged the already\\r\\r\\nsleepless poet Gregory Orr,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nwho shot his brother, too, and\\r\\r\\nsuffers that endless error\\r\\r\\nin poetry and prose. And because Molly\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nrefused everything, she stood between\\r\\r\\nRalph and tomorrow. But he grew, he\\r\\r\\nchanged. Confused? Read\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nthe book. In novels\\r\\r\\npeople die because of what they feel.\\r\\r\\nIn life, people die when\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ntheir bodies conk out,\\r\\r\\nexhausted machines that living\\r\\r\\nexpends. And what\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nhappens when people feel\\r\\r\\ntheir feelings in life?\\r\\r\\nNothing? Anything? Brenda,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ndear Brenda, my love, nothing\\r\\r\\nhappens, I’m afraid. I’m sorry. And afraid.\\r\\r\\nA small breeze born in the heart\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ngently bends a blade of grass\\r\\r\\nand no one hears a word.\\r\\r\\nNo one reads Stafford anymore—I asked\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\non Facebook. Stafford died, her\\r\\r\\nlegacy gently dispatched\\r\\r\\ninto the low air. O, life\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nis terrible, literature\\r\\r\\nridiculous. Stafford’s prose,\\r\\r\\nteeming and rich as loam,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ncould take Famous Franzen’s\\r\\r\\nfor a walk, feed it biscuits.\\r\\r\\nBut who cares? Who remembers?\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nO, to have been Jean Stafford,\\r\\r\\nin the past I idealize, when the world\\r\\r\\nwas less self-conscious, less\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nprecise. I could be\\r\\r\\ndead already, warmish\\r\\r\\nbeneath a blanket of dust. Joyful\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nare the faded, the once-greats\\r\\r\\nwhose afterlives slipped out\\r\\r\\na hole in posterity's pocket:\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nthey are loved poignantly by\\r\\r\\na needy few. O, to be kept\\r\\r\\ncozy in the bosoms of those\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ndesperate and proud, forgotten\\r\\r\\nfor all the good I do. Love\\r\\r\\nis sunlight streaming unevenly\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nthrough the canopy of leaves\\r\\r\\noverhead. We can only grow\\r\\r\\nin the brighter patches below, fading\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nwhere light is thin. Molly,\\r\\r\\nwe are with you, nowhere and gone.\\r\\r\\nMostly we are forgotten, too.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n   \n134

winning\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nthe Pulitzer with her devastating,\\r\\r\\nhurtfully compassionate Collected Stories—for this or any other world,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nespecially the necessarily\\r\\r\\nallegorical one of fiction.\\r\\r\\nI am broken now, hopeless; hope\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nis proved by this book to be\\r\\r\\na contrivance. I have just\\r\\r\\nread the last pages in which\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nMolly’s brother, Ralph—who,\\r\\r\\nto live, cannot love\\r\\r\\neither, has no spare love—shoots\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nher, aiming for the wild mountain\\r\\r\\nlion whose stuffed corpse\\r\\r\\nwas to be the triumph\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nof his new manhood. I don’t\\r\\r\\nhate Ralph—how can I, a boy,\\r\\r\\nmistaken, like me? And can I hate\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nMolly, who so needed Ralph\\r\\r\\nand everyone, still young enough to savor\\r\\r\\nthe bittersweet of her anger?\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nWhat about Stafford, who hurt\\r\\r\\nherself, all our selves, with\\r\\r\\nthis ending, her classic tragedy, writing,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ndecades later, Poor old Molly! I loved her dearly and I hope she rests in peace.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nFuck insight and analysis:\\r\\r\\nmy heart is shot. Why\\r\\r\\ndid she have to die? Why does\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nanyone? Why do you, do I?\\r\\r\\nBecause of what Ralph was\\r\\r\\nfeeling just before he accidentally\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nslaughtered the future? This book\\r\\r\\nmust have ravaged the already\\r\\r\\nsleepless poet Gregory Orr,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nwho shot his brother, too, and\\r\\r\\nsuffers that endless error\\r\\r\\nin poetry and prose. And because Molly\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nrefused everything, she stood between\\r\\r\\nRalph and tomorrow. But he grew, he\\r\\r\\nchanged. Confused? Read\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nthe book. In novels\\r\\r\\npeople die because of what they feel.\\r\\r\\nIn life, people die when\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ntheir bodies conk out,\\r\\r\\nexhausted machines that living\\r\\r\\nexpends.

I’m sorry. And afraid.\\r\\r\\nA small breeze born in the heart\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ngently bends a blade of grass\\r\\r\\nand no one hears a word.\\r\\r\\nNo one reads Stafford anymore—I asked\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\non Facebook. Stafford died, her\\r\\r\\nlegacy gently dispatched\\r\\r\\ninto the low air. O, life\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nis terrible, literature\\r\\r\\nridiculous. Stafford’s prose,\\r\\r\\nteeming and rich as loam,\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\ncould take Famous Franzen’s\\r\\r\\nfor a walk, feed it biscuits.\\r\\r\\nBut who cares? Who remembers?\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nO, to have been Jean Stafford,\\r\\r\\nin the past I idealize, when the world\\r\\r\\nwas less self-conscious, less\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nprecise. I could be\\r\\r\\ndead already, warmish\\r\\r\\nbeneath a blanket of dust.

perverse, short,\\nlyrical novel, her second, during\\n \\nthe flailing failings\\nof her marriage to my hero\\nRobert Lowell—kills\\n \\nMolly, her child-alter ego,\\na girl too unloved and unloving\\nto survive puberty, too\\n \\npure and awful—like Stafford, who died\\npickled and childish three\\ndecades later after winning\\n \\nthe Pulitzer with her devastating,\\nhurtfully compassionate Collected Stories—for this or any other world,\\n \\nespecially the necessarily\\nallegorical one of fiction.\\nI am broken now, hopeless; hope\\n \\nis proved by this book to be\\na contrivance. I have just\\nread the last pages in which\\n \\nMolly’s brother, Ralph—who,\\nto live, cannot love\\neither, has no spare love—shoots\\n \\nher, aiming for the wild mountain\\nlion whose stuffed corpse\\nwas to be the triumph\\n \\nof his new manhood. I don’t\\nhate Ralph—how can I, a boy,\\nmistaken, like me? And can I hate\\n \\nMolly, who so needed Ralph\\nand everyone, still young enough to savor\\nthe bittersweet of her anger?\\n \\nWhat about Stafford, who hurt\\nherself, all our selves, with\\nthis ending, her classic tragedy, writing,\\n \\ndecades later, Poor old Molly! I loved her dearly and I hope she rests in peace.\\n \\nFuck insight and analysis:\\nmy heart is shot. Why\\ndid she have to die? Why does\\n \\nanyone? Why do you, do I?\\nBecause of what Ralph was\\nfeeling just before he accidentally\\n \\nslaughtered the future? This book\\nmust have ravaged the already\\nsleepless poet Gregory Orr,\\n \\nwho shot his brother, too, and\\nsuffers that endless error\\nin poetry and prose. And because Molly\\n \\nrefused everything, she stood between\\nRalph and tomorrow. But he grew, he\\nchanged. Confused? Read\\n \\nthe book. In novels\\npeople die because of what they feel.\\nIn life, people die when\\n \\ntheir bodies conk out,\\nexhausted machines that living\\nexpends. And what\\n \\nhappens when people feel\\ntheir feelings in life?\\nNothing? Anything? Brenda,\\n \\ndear Brenda, my love, nothing\\nhappens, I’m afraid. I’m sorry. And afraid.\\nA small breeze born in the heart\\n \\ngently bends a blade of grass\\nand no one hears a word.\\nNo one reads Stafford anymore—I asked\\n \\non Facebook. Stafford died, her\\nlegacy gently dispatched\\ninto the low air. O, life\\n \\nis terrible, literature\\nridiculous. Stafford’s prose,\\nteeming and rich as loam,\\n \\ncould take Famous Franzen’s\\nfor a walk, feed it biscuits.\\nBut who cares? Who remembers?\\n \\nO, to have been Jean Stafford,\\nin the past I idealize, when the world\\nwas less self-conscious, less\\n \\nprecise. I could be\\ndead already, warmish\\nbeneath a blanket of dust. Joyful\\n \\nare the faded, the once-greats\\nwhose afterlives slipped out\\na hole in posterity's pocket:\\n \\nthey are loved poignantly by\\na needy few. O, to be kept\\ncozy in the bosoms of those\\n \\ndesperate and proud, forgotten\\nfor all the good I do. Love\\nis sunlight streaming unevenly\\n \\nthrough the canopy of leaves\\noverhead. We can only grow\\nin the brighter patches below, fading\\n \\nwhere light is thin.

START spoiler alert : in this all-but-forgotten N masterwork , jean stafford—who was once N widely regarded as the leading novelist N N of her generation , and who wrote N this perverse , short , N lyrical novel , her second , during N N the flailing failings N of her marriage to my hero N robert lowell—kills N N molly , her child-alter ego , N a girl too unloved and unloving N to survive puberty , too N N pure and awful—like stafford , who died N pickled and childish three N decades later after winning N N the pulitzer with her devastating , N hurtfully compassionate collected stories—for this or any other world , N N especially the necessarily N allegorical one of fiction . N i am broken now , hopeless ; hope N N is proved by this book to be N a contrivance . i have just N read the last pages in which N N mollys brother , ralph—who , N to live , can not love N either , has no spare love—shoots N N her , aiming for the wild mountain N lion whose stuffed corpse N was to be the triumph N N of his new manhood . i dont N hate ralph—how can i , a boy , N mistaken , like me ? and can i hate N N molly , who so needed ralph N and everyone , still young enough to savor N the bittersweet of her anger ? N N what about stafford , who hurt N herself , all our selves , with N this ending , her classic tragedy , writing , N N decades later , poor old molly ! i loved her dearly and i hope she rests in peace . N N fuck insight and analysis : N my heart is shot . why N did she have to die ? why does N N anyone ? why do you , do i ? N because of what ralph was N feeling just before he accidentally N N slaughtered the future ? this book N must have ravaged the already N sleepless poet gregory orr , N N who shot his brother , too , and N suffers that endless error N in poetry and prose . and because molly N N refused everything , she stood between N ralph and tomorrow . but he grew , he N changed . confused ? read N N the book . in novels N people die because of what they feel . N in life , people die when N N their bodies conk out , N exhausted machines that living N expends . and what N N happens when people feel N their feelings in life ? N nothing ? anything ? brenda , N N dear brenda , my love , nothing N happens , im afraid . im sorry . and afraid . N a small breeze born in the heart N N gently bends a blade of grass N and no one hears a word . N no one reads stafford anymore—i asked N N on facebook . stafford died , her N legacy gently dispatched N into the low air . o , life N N is terrible , literature N ridiculous . staffords prose , N teeming and rich as loam , N N could take famous franzens N for a walk , feed it biscuits . N but who cares ? who remembers ? N N o , to have been jean stafford , N in the past i idealize , when the world N was less self-conscious , less N N precise . i could be N dead already , warmish N beneath a blanket of dust . joyful N N are the faded , the once-greats N whose afterlives slipped out N a hole in posteritys pocket : N N they are loved poignantly by N a needy few . o , to be kept N cozy in the bosoms of those N N desperate and proud , forgotten N for all the good i do . love N is sunlight streaming unevenly N N through the canopy of leaves N overhead . we can only grow N in the brighter patches below , fading N N where light is thin . molly , N we are with you , nowhere and gone . N mostly we are forgotten , too .
